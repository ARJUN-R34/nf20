# NF20

Keep calm and fractionalize your NFTs.

## Introduction

This is a platform where the users can transfer their valuable NFTs, fractionalize and mint ERC-1155 fungible tokens in return. The users can trade their nft derived tokens in secondary markets.

**Note:** We will be coming out with a marketplace where the users can trade their fractionalized tokens.

Also trading the tokens in the secondary market will have a trading fee for the platform, a part of which becomes dividend income for the token holders, incentivising demand and holding behaviour.

There is also a space for derivative instruments like ETFs, Options and futures like actual stock market, which makes sense because NFT inherently has some value, unlike other fantasy exchanges.
